Municipal Funding Platform - Specifications Document
Scope
Background: Munify (https://munify.in/)  is India’s ﬁrst national municipal database built with the budgets and ﬁnancial statements of the municipal corporations of India. The contextual operational information was added, and the analysis was crystallized as credit scores and grades and published in April 2023.  In January 2024, the second edition of the credit grades was published with the latest available ﬁnancial results. The third edition of the credit grades will be published in September 2025.
Munify’s subscribers include multilateral agencies, rating agencies, consulting ﬁrms, regulators and academia. Munify’s infographic dashboard, a visual presentation of the municipal ﬁnances of India, iiis co-branded with NIUA, the urban research arm of the Government of India.

Munify is setting up an online ﬁnancing platform for Municipal projects, as a use case of its credit grades. The ﬁnancing will include both grant funding and project ﬁnancing.
Munify’s financing platform is to bring municipal commissioners (borrowers and grantees) and the funders (lenders) to a platform to enable financing of municipal projects.
The Municipal Funding Platform is designed to facilitate transparent information sharing, communication, and timely alerts among various stakeholders involved in municipal projects. It does not handle the actual flow of funds between lenders and borrowers.
